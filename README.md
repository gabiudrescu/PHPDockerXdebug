# PHPDockerXdebug

For those moments when you need a quick copy paste of a Docker setup.

This setup includes:
 - Dockerized PHP-FPM based on PHP FPM Alpine 7.3
 - Nginx as multi-stage
 - Xdebug easy on/off setup

----

Configured with the help and goodwill of my friend [@redecs](https://redecs.net/) plus my google-fu skillset. 

And coffee. Lots of coffee.
